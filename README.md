# Very Extensive Container Library
`vecl` is a header-only container Library written with **modern C++**. 
It provides an extensive number of multi-purpose containers/constructs with many use cases. 
While "extensive" may be an overstatement, the idea is to motivate myself to keep improving the
library until the word may be used to describe it.<br/>

### Goals

1. provide a multi-purpose set of containers with many use cases

3. improve as a programmer
